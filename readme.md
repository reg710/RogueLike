# Rogue Like Console Game

This is an Academy PGH project to build a rogue like game. In my version of the game, the player is represented by a '+' and needs to collect all the treasures '$'on the board to win. There are a random number of treasures, as well as a random number of traps '0' and these will end the game if the player lands on one. I also built a moving threat 'X' that is linked to the player's movements and will also end the game if it lands on a treasure or trap.

### Updates for the future
I'd love to rewrite the game using classes/methods instead of the many loops.
